## [1.0.0] — Pure TypeScript Rewrite

The entire project has been rewritten from scratch. numasec is now a single TypeScript application — no Python, no bridge, no runtime dependencies.

### Architecture

- Single compiled binary via `bun build`. No Python, no pip, no Docker required.
- 21 native TypeScript security tools, registered via `Tool.define()`.
- Generic payload→response scanner engine replacing ~10 individual scanners.
- BM25 knowledge base retriever with 35 YAML attack templates.
- PTES 5-phase deterministic planner with replan signals (based on [CHECKMATE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11143)).
- Finding enrichment pipeline: CWE → CVSS 3.1 → OWASP Top 10 → MITRE ATT&CK.
- Attack chain grouping algorithm with URL-based clustering.
- SARIF 2.1.0, HTML (Bootstrap), and Markdown report generators.
- npm distribution with platform-specific binary packages.

### Security Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `recon` | Port scan + service probe + tech fingerprint |
| `crawl` | Spider + OpenAPI + sitemap discovery |
| `dir_fuzz` | Directory brute-force |
| `js_analyze` | JS endpoint/secret extraction |
| `injection_test` | SQL/NoSQL/SSTI/CmdI/CRLF/LFI/XXE |
| `xss_test` | Reflected XSS |
| `auth_test` | JWT analysis + credential testing |
| `access_control_test` | IDOR/CSRF/CORS/mass assignment |
| `ssrf_test` | SSRF with cloud metadata |
| `upload_test` | File upload bypass |
| `race_test` | Race condition detection |
| `graphql_test` | Introspection, batching, depth attacks |
| `kb_search` | Security knowledge base search (BM25) |
| `pentest_plan` | PTES methodology planner |
| `save_finding` | Persist finding with auto-enrichment |
| `get_findings` | Retrieve findings |
| `build_chains` | Group findings into attack chains |
| `generate_report` | SARIF/HTML/Markdown report |
| `http_request` | Raw HTTP with full control |
| `security_shell` | Shell execution (nmap, sqlmap, etc.) |
| `browser` | Playwright automation |

### Agent Modes

- **pentest** — full PTES methodology (default)
- **recon** — reconnaissance only, no exploitation
- **hunt** — systematic OWASP Top 10 sweep
- **review** — secure code review, no network scanning
- **report** — finding management and deliverables

### Distribution

- `npm install -g numasec` — platform-specific binary via optionalDependencies
- `install.sh` — build from source, symlink to `~/.local/bin`
- Docker images on Docker Hub and GHCR
- GitHub Releases with per-platform archives
